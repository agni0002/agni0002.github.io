                                                    How I created the website?
For Creating this Website I had to first make a mockup of the site. I used very basic of what I have learned throughout the course and tried to implement pretty much every topic we covered.For the content I had to chose images that describe the best of what I do in my life as I didnot have my own pictures. I mostly used CSS, Bootstrap and flexbox throughout the website. Very elemental use of html and css have been done.
                                          What Challenges I faced and solved them?
I faced many challenges like optimising the image and using the flexbox for aligning items, but after watching previos class videos I was able to figure that out. For optimsing the image I used auto margin to get over the problem.
Another problem I was facing was that I was not able to make the "to the top button" working because I was trying to put a button in a <a> tag and validator gave me an error and a fix to that as well.
